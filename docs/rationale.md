autohelm_app is a croos-platform mobile application that emulates the Autohelm remote control as in docs/real.jpg

Original Autohelm remote control allows user to change vessel's COG (Cape On Ground) by +/- 1 degrees or +/- 10 degrees.
Mobile application uses NMEA0183 protocol on WiFi, as exposed by Yacht Device Gateway (https://www.yachtd.com/products/wifi_0183_gateway.html).

Application look mimics remote control as in picure.

Application is built with Flutter framework.
